# Institute Admin Role - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Institute Admin role has been successfully implemented to provide institute-level administration capabilities. Institute Admins can manage their specific institute's teachers and students while having limited scope compared to Super Admins.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Super Admin Functionality**
- âœ… **Create Institute Admin button** added to Super Admin dashboard
- âœ… Located in sidebar navigation below "Create Student"
- âœ… Uses orange Shield icon for visual distinction
- âœ… Opens CreateUserModal with `INSTITUTE_ADMIN` role

### 2. **Institute Admin Dashboard** (`/institute-admin-dashboard`)
- âœ… **Institute Information Card**: Shows institute details (name, code, location)
- âœ… **Real-time Statistics**: 
  - Total Students (scoped to their institute)
  - Total Teachers (scoped to their institute)  
  - Ongoing Tests
  - Institute Performance metrics
- âœ… **Quick Action Cards**: Create Teacher and Create Student
- âœ… **Professional Layout**: Similar to Super Admin but institute-focused

### 3. **Role-Based Navigation**
- âœ… **Institute Admin Navigation Menu**:
  - Dashboard
  - Student Management
  - Course Management
  - Test Creation
  - Analytics
  - Create Teacher (action)
  - Create Student (action)
- âœ… **Proper Role Hierarchy**: Institute Admin < Super Admin

### 4. **User Management**
- âœ… **Create Teachers**: Automatically assigned to their institute
- âœ… **Create Students**: Automatically assigned to their institute
- âœ… **Pre-filled Institute**: No need to select institute (auto-filled)
- âœ… **Institute Scoped**: Can only see users from their institute
