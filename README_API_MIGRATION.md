## üèó Architecture Changes

### Service Layer
```
Old: Component ‚Üí Supabase Service ‚Üí Supabase Client
New: Component ‚Üí Legacy Service ‚Üí New Service ‚Üí API Client ‚Üí TestPire API
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Old: Email/Password ‚Üí Supabase Auth ‚Üí Session Cookies
New: Username/Password ‚Üí TestPire API ‚Üí JWT Tokens ‚Üí localStorage
```

### User Roles
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full system access, institute management
- **INST_ADMIN**: Institute-specific administration
- **TEACHER**: Student and test management within scope
- **STUDENT**: Test-taking and progress viewing

## üîë Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://testpire-svc.brz9vh5stea0g.ap-south-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/api
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start the application** as usual with `npm start` or `yarn start`
2. **Check console** for API connection status on startup
3. **Login** using the new username/password format
4. **Explore new features**:
   - Super Admin: `/institute-management` and `/user-management`
   - Institute Admin: `/user-management` 
   - All roles: Enhanced dashboard functionality

## üß™ Testing

Run API tests in the browser console:
```javascript
// Test API connection
import('./src/utils/testApiConnection.js').then(module => {
  module.runAPITests();
});
```

## üìÅ File Changes Made

### New Files Created
- `src/lib/apiClient.js` - HTTP client with JWT handling
- `src/services/newAuthService.js` - New authentication service
- `src/services/newUserService.js` - New user management service
- `src/services/newInstituteService.js` - Institute management service
- `src/services/newDashboardService.js` - Dashboard service
- `src/services/placeholderServices.js` - Placeholder implementations
- `src/pages/institute-management-screen/` - Complete institute management UI
- `src/pages/enhanced-user-management-screen/` - Enhanced user management UI
- `src/utils/testApiConnection.js` - API testing utilities
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed migration documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Updated to use new auth service
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Deprecated with compatibility warnings
- All existing service files - Now forward to new implementations
- `src/Routes.jsx` - Added new page routes
- `src/App.jsx` - Added startup API connection testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing UI components should continue to work
2. **Gradual Migration**: Some features use placeholder services until backend endpoints are available
3. **Role-Based Access**: New permission system is more granular
4. **Token Management**: Automatic JWT token handling with refresh logic
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Try logging in with actual user accounts
2. **Verify Existing Features**: Ensure all current functionality works
3. **Explore New Features**: Test institute and user management
4. **Backend Integration**: As more API endpoints become available, replace placeholder services
5. **User Training**: Brief users on any workflow changes (like username vs email login)

## üÜò Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Browser Console** for detailed error messages
2. **Review Network Tab** for API request/response details
3. **Use Testing Utilities** to diagnose connection issues
4. **Reference Documentation** in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

The migration maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new features. All existing functionality should continue to work, and new API-based features are ready to use immediately.

üéâ **Migration Complete - Your TestMaster application is now powered by the TestPire API!**
